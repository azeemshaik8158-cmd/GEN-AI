# 🤖 Generative AI and LLM Projects

This repository contains my hands-on Generative AI projects built using Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agent-based AI workflows.

---

## 📌 Overview
These projects focus on applying modern Generative AI techniques to real-world problems such as:

- Document understanding  
- Question answering  
- Decision support automation  
- Multi-agent reasoning workflows  

The goal is to build practical, explainable, and production-oriented AI systems rather than just experimental demos.
